      <h3>Performance marketing on programmatic</h3>
      <p>I have managed RTB campaigns (UA performance campaigns/Retargeting campaigns) for around five years. I don't want to say that I saw it all, but I definitely had enough time to fall in love with it. What else have I done here? Playable creative optimization. Interaction analysis. Conversion optimization. </p>

      <h3>Data visualization</h3>
      <p>I can tell stories for online marketing campaigns with graphs and charts. They are pretty different from the stories you can hear in your everyday life, not less exciting though ☺</p>
